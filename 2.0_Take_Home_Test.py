HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Typed: Alexander J Randall :O

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
 #this is a comment



2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 == 0.6666666666666666 This is division
2 // 3 == 0 This floors the division
3/2 == 1.5 Again this is divison
3//2 == 1 This floors 1.5 to 1





3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b

This sets the variable a to equal 22 and b = to 13 when you do the equation c = a+b it really is c = 22 + 13 or 35 = 35




4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle

area_of_rectangle because it is specific and doesn't use capitals



5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple Allowed
Apple Allowed
APPLE Allowed
Apple2 Allowed
1Apple Not Allowed
account number Not Allowed
account_number Allowed
account.number Not Allowed
accountNumber Allowed
account# Not Allowed
pi Allowed
PI Allowed
fred Allowed
Fred Allowed
GreatBigVariable Allowed
greatBigVariable Allowed
great_big_variable Allowed
great.big.variable Not Allowed
2x Not Allowed
x2x Allowed
total% Not Allowed
#left Not Allowed






6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2        == a=2
a*=10       == a=20
a/=2        == a=10
a+=12       == a=22
a-=7        == a=15
a           == a=15
type(a)     == float???







7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area

radius=10
pi=3.14
area=pi*radius**2
Area

8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42)        == <class 'int'>
type(42.0)      == <class 'float'>
type("C3PO")    == <class 'str'>
type(True)      == <class 'bool'>







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5       the y was a capital
a = 3(x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave

Its dividing the z not the sum
To fix it you should use a parenthesis
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
ave
